# ParkingLot_LLD_Machine-Coding

Problem statement: https://workat.tech/machine-coding/practice/design-parking-lot-qm6hwq4wkhp8

Notes( before coding the solution )

- Classes:

        ParkingLotSystem -> Main function

        ParkingLotServices -> service layer

        DAO with singleton and threadsafe

        Utility classes / enums

- Data Models/ Entities

    ParkingLots
    Vehicles
    Tickets
    Floor
    Slots


- Parse Input from main

## Possible improvements:

Handling extensibility of working with multiple parkingLots concurrently.
Having a good unit test strategy in place.
Improving efficiency of algorithms.
